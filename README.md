# fft
Experimentations with FFT on images: computation, visualisation and inverseFFT

The purpose of this project is to experiment with 2D Fourier Transforms. It comes with a simple way to create test patterns, play with FFT and a more ambitious "colored FFT" program that explores the beauty of phase + module combinations.

The code uses OpenCV (cv2) library to display images and provides a simple keystroke driven user interaction. The FFT is implemented using the NumPy fft module.
